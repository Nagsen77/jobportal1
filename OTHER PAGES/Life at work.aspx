                            How often do you get the Sunday evening blues? Every now and again, or every 
                            week without fail? If it is the latter, maybe you should think about moving on
 
                            But lots of people find themselves in the situation where they are not ready to 
                            move jobs just yet perhaps because they have only been in the role a short time, 
                            or because they want to gain more experience. So if you find yourself in the 
                            situation where you are in a job that is okay but not brilliant, or that you 
                            really need to see through for a period of time, what can you do to make it more 
                            interesting and - dare we say it more fun?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Here are some suggestions:</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Positive Thinking</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                            Focus on the positives what do you really like about your job (come on, there 
                            must be something)? How could you incorporate more of that into your working 
                            day? Remind yourself of the other positive aspects of your work your friends 
                            and colleagues, for instance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Challenge Yourself</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                            Find new challenges. One of the reasons that we can get restless in our job is, 
                            quite simply, boredom. Think about ways in which you could make your role more 
                            interesting. Perhaps you could volunteer to mentor new staff, or spend some time 
                            every week shadowing people in other departments to get a broader perspective on 
                            the business? Discuss your ideas with your manager.<span 
                                class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Flexible Working</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                            Is there scope for you to work more flexibly? Working from home one day a week, 
                            for example, could give you more variety. This is not an excuse to get up late 
                            and lie around watching daytime TV, though you all need to be able to show some 
                            output for your time away from the office! Again, discuss the options with your 
                            manager.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Learn More</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                            If you feel you are not being stimulated enough mentally, consider doing some 
                            training or a course that is work-related: it will give you new insights, help 
                            to keep you fresh, and will be a useful addition to your CV when you are ready 
                            to move on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Network</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                            Network more. If meeting new people is not already part of your role, find ways 
                            to incorporate it. Meeting people and getting fresh perspectives can help you to 
                            keep yourself interested and interesting. If there don't seem to be many 
                            networking opportunities where you are, create some! Organize a team outing, or 
                            arrange for you and your colleagues to meet up with staff from another part of 
                            the company.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Have Some Fun</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                            Inject a bit of fun into your workplace. That could be as simple as croissants 
                            on a Monday morning or a team drink on Friday afternoon. Or it could be a more 
                            structured social event. Your work colleagues don't have to be your bosom 
                            buddies, but you all enjoy your working day much more if there is a bit of banter 
                            and humour around. Just because your work is a serious business doesn't mean you 
                            cant have fun while you do it!<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />

                            <strong>Improve Your Social Life</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                            Make an effort to do more interesting things outside of work. If your working 
                            week consists of getting up in the morning, going to work, coming home, having 
                            dinner, slumping in front of the TV and then going to bed, your job is going to 
                            have a disproportionate impact on your overall mood. Try to fit a couple of 
                            social engagements into your week a dancing class or an art exhibition, 
                            perhaps, or just a catch-up with friends you havent seen for a while. Having 
                            something to look forward to during the week will help to make it more bearable.<span

                            <strong>Prioritise Your Workload</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                            If you find that your problem is you are working such long hours that you don,t 
                            have time to have fun outside work, let alone in the office, you need to tackle 
                            this. Get used to prioritizing your workload&nbsp; negotiate extensions to 
                            deadlines if necessary and make yourself leave the office on time at least 3 
                            nights a week. Most of us have periods when were extra-busy and end up working 
                            long hours, but if this is happening to you routinely, you need to get out of 
                            that rut.</td>
